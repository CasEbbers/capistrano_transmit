CapistranoDatabaseTasks
=======================

A plugin to fetch the production database and overwrite your local development database.
I am going to add methods for assets as well. And who knows, methods to push your
development database to the production server as well. Although I think that's scary.

The only thing this plugin does, is extend Capistrano. No Rails code is loaded.
Capistrano loads the scripts in the recipes directory, and that's just what we need.


Example
=======

cap db:fetch
