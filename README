CapistranoDatabaseTasks
=======================

This plugin allows you to fetch the production database and assets and store them
on your local development environment.

The only thing this plugin does, is extend Capistrano. No Rails code is loaded.
Capistrano loads the scripts in the recipes directory, and that's just what we need.


Installation
============

ruby script/plugin install git://github.com/tilsammans/Capistrano-Database-Tasks.git



Examples
========

cap db:fetch        # Fetch the remote production database and overwrite your local development database with it
cap assets:fetch    # Fetch the remote assets into your local development environment


Prerequisites
=============

This Capistrano extension assumes some variables are present in your deploy.rb:

user			# the SSH user for connecting to the deploy host
deploy_host		# the host on which to run the db dump
